The code in files in this directory is based on the paper:
> "Computing automorphisms of modular curves", Lido Guido, Mercuri Pietro, preprint.

The code in the file "find_modular_automorphisms.txt" finds a sequence N of representative matrices of the elements of the modular automorphism group of a modular curve X_H for H a subgroup of GL_2(Z/nZ).
Moreover, it gives the subgroup of the symmetric group of #N elements isomorphic as group to N.
More details are given inside the file.

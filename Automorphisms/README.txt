The code in files in this directory is based on the paper:
> "Computing automorphisms of modular curves", Lido Guido, Mercuri Pietro, preprint.

The code in the file "find_modular_automorphisms.txt" computes the group G of modular automorphisms of the modular curve X_H for H a subgroup of GL_2(Z/nZ). More in detail, it finds a sequence of matrices representing all elements in G and gives a subgroup of the symmetric group on #G elements isomorphic to G.
More details are given inside the file.

The file "find_modular_automorphisms_examples.txt" contains some examples of use of the code contained in "find_modular_automorphisms.txt".

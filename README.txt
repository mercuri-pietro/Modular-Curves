This repository contains code for functions and examples to make computations related to modular curves.
Each directory contains a readme file explaining further details concerning that directory.

The directory "Automorphisms" contains codes related to the computation of the automorphisms of modular curves.

The directory "Many_points_modular_curves" contains codes related to the computation of the number of points of modular curves over finite fields.

The directory "Nonsplit_Cartan_curves" contains codes related to the computation of explicit equations of nonsplit Cartan modular curves of prime level.
The codes in this directory are related with the paper:

The code in files in this directory is based on the paper:
> "Two maximal curves over F_{11^5} and a modular isogeny", Dose Valerio, Lido Guido, Mercuri Pietro, Stirpe Claudio, preprint.

The file "Check_non-modular_automorphisms_mod_5.txt" contains the code to show that the modular curve X_(6,7)/<w_6,w_7> has no non-modular automorphisms checking the automorphisms modulo 5.

The file "Computation_of_equations.txt" contains the code to compute the equation of the canonical model of the modular curve X_(6,7)/<w_6,w_7>.

The file "Equations_curve_X(6,7)_mod_w6,w7.txt" contains the equations in Magma readable format of the modular curve X_(6,7)/<w_6,w_7> both for the canonical model and a planar singular model.

The file "Equations_curve_X0(156)_mod_w13.txt" contains the equations in Magma readable format of the modular curve X_0(156)/<w_13> both for the canonical model and a planar singular model.
